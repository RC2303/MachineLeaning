# Predicting Titanic Passenger Survival Rate

## Introduction
The goal of this assignment is to create a machine learning model able to predict the survival rate of Titanic passengers. A provided dataset will be used to train a regression model able to achieve considerable accuracy in predicting heart failure. The main objective is to get familiar with the preliminary steps of any ML model training.

## Main Steps
- **Data loading**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** (data visualization and analysis)
- **Data transformation**
- **Data cleaning**
- **Feature engineering**
- **Model training**
- **Model Evaluation**
